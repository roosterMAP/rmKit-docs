rmKit Documetation
==================

**rmKit** is an addon for Blender that contains a wide variety of tools designer to streamline my personal workflow.
The bulk of the tools aim to bolster Blender's modeling and uving tools.
`The addon itself can be found on my personal GitHub <https://github.com/roosterMAP/rmKit>`_
Feel free to use the addon any way you like!
