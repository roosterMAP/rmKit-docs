rmKit Documetation
==================

**rmKit** is an addon for Blender that contains a wide variety of tools designed to streamline my personal workflow.
The bulk of the tools aim to bolster Blender's modeling and uving tools.
`The addon itself can be found on my personal GitHub <https://github.com/roosterMAP/rmKit>`_ .
Feel free to use the addon any way you like!

.. note::

	* This project is under active development.
	* Only Blender 3.3+ is supported.
	* `Please report bugs here. <https://github.com/roosterMAP/rmKit/issues>`_
	* None of the ops currently support multiple active meshes.
