``Export Manager`` is a light weight fbx exported used to quickly add objects in the scene to an export list, and export them individually or in groups.

* ``Add`` will add the objects selected in the scene to the export list.
* ``Remove`` will remove items selected in the **Export Manager** from the export list.
* ``Export`` will export the export item and its children in the scene to an fbx based on its name.
* ``Export Checked`` will export all export items that are checked in the list view.
* ``Settings`` will open a dialog where you can set the base and export path. Combine the **PathStrings** listed in the dialog to control where export items write out their fbx's.
