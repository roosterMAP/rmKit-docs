.. note::
	All user addons are added to the following directories:
	* Winddows: ``%appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.XX\scripts\addons\``
	* Mac: ``~/Library/Application Support/Blender Foundation/Blender/2.XX/scripts/addons/``
	You may manually install/uninstall from there.


Preferences
------------

Currently, only Hotkeys are shown in the addon preferences. To learn what a command does, you will have to look it up in the docs.
Once the rmKit addon is enabled in ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``, you can expand its tab to reveal the Hotkeys panel.
Listed are all the operators that are included in the addon. While some are already exposed in the 3DVIEW and UVVIEW tool panels, many more only available once bound to a key.
