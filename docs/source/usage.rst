Installation
------------

rmKit has been split up into two addons: ``rmKit`` and ``rmKitUV``. The first one is the main addon, while the second one is a UV editor addon. Both are installed in the same way.

Both addons are hosted on the extensions platform. You can download the latest stable release from there.

Preferences
------------

Currently, only Hotkeys are shown in the addon preferences. To learn what a command does, you will have to look it up in the docs.
Once the rmKit addon is enabled in ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``, you can expand its tab to reveal the Hotkeys panel.
