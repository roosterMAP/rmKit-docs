Installation
------------

rmKit has been split up into two addons: ``rmKit`` and ``rmKitUV``. The first one is the main addon, while the second one is a UV editor addon. Both are installed in the same way.
The addon is distributed as a .zip file. You can download the latest version from the `rmKit <https://github.com/roosterMAP/rmKit>` and `rmKitUV <https://github.com/roosterMAP/rmKitUV>` repositories.

To install the addon:

#. Go to ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install``.
#. Select the downloaded .zip file.
#. Enable the addon by clicking a tick box near its name.
#. Find the tab for the installed addon on the 3DVIEW tool panel.
#. Click on the ``Download rmlib`` button to download the latest version of the rmLib library.
#. Restart Blender to make sure the addon is fully loaded.

To uninstall the addon:

#. Go to ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``.
#. Navigate to the addon in the list and expand its tab.
#. Press the ``Remove`` button.


.. note::
	All user addons are added to the following directories:
	* Winddows: ``%appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.XX\scripts\addons\``
	* Mac: ``~/Library/Application Support/Blender Foundation/Blender/2.XX/scripts/addons/``
	You may manually install/uninstall from there.


Preferences
------------

Currently, only Hotkeys are shown in the addon preferences. To learn what a command does, you will have to look it up in the docs.
Once the rmKit addon is enabled in ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``, you can expand its tab to reveal the Hotkeys panel.
